# Real-Time AQI Analysis

## Overview
This project performs a real-time analysis of Air Quality Index (AQI) data. The analysis includes web scraping to gather AQI data and further analysis using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Datasets
- **real_time_aqi_data.csv**: Contains AQI data collected from web scraping.

## Analysis
The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`web_scraping_analysis.ipynb`) which:
- Scrapes AQI data from a web source.
- Cleans and processes the data.
- Visualizes trends and provides insights on air quality.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Install any necessary Python packages (listed in the notebook).
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.
